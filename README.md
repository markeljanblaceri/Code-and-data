# Code-and-data

The repository houses the data and code necessary to replicate the findings of the paper **"Labor Market Flows in Albania: Estimating Job Finding and Employment Exit Probabilities"**. 

The data and results are provided in the file **"Albania JFP.xlsx"**, while the Matlab code is available in **"LaborMarket.m"**.

Results will be updated regularly and shared on my personal webpage https://sites.google.com/view/markeljanblaceri/home.
